## üöÄ Performance Optimization for Large Environments

### Cache Warming & Data Preparation

**üè¢ Enterprise environments with large data footprints (100GB+ or 1M+ files)** may experience slower initial responses as Aparavi Analytics processes complex queries. Here's how to optimize performance:

#### Automatic Cache Warming with Run-All-Reports Script

The included PowerShell script pre-executes all reports to warm up Aparavi's analytics cache, dramatically improving response times for subsequent Claude conversations.

**Windows Setup (Recommended for Large Environments):**

```powershell
# Navigate to the project directory
cd aparavi_data_suite_mcp

# Quick cache warm-up (excludes slow reports - takes 5-10 minutes)
.\scripts\run-all-reports.ps1

# Complete cache warm-up (includes all reports - takes 15-30 minutes)
.\scripts\run-all-reports.ps1 -IncludeSlow

# Interactive mode - choose which reports to run
.\scripts\run-all-reports.ps1 -Interactive

# For remote Aparavi instances
.\scripts\run-all-reports.ps1 -AparaviHost "192.168.1.100" -Username "admin" -Password "yourpassword"
```

**Mac/Linux Setup:**

```bash
# Run via PowerShell Core (install if needed: brew install powershell)
pwsh ./scripts/run-all-reports.ps1

# Alternative: Use the MCP server to run reports
# Start Claude Desktop and run:
# "Run all available reports to warm up the cache"
```

#### What Cache Warming Does

**Before Warming:** First-time queries may take 30-120 seconds as Aparavi:
- Indexes file metadata across data sources
- Calculates complex aggregations (duplicates, growth trends)
- Builds internal query optimization plans

**After Warming:** Same queries respond in 2-10 seconds because:
- ‚úÖ Analytics results are cached in memory
- ‚úÖ Query execution plans are optimized
- ‚úÖ File metadata is pre-indexed
- ‚úÖ Complex calculations are pre-computed

#### Performance Optimization Schedule

**Daily (Automated):**
```powershell
# Schedule via Windows Task Scheduler or cron
.\scripts\run-all-reports.ps1 -IncludeSlow > cache-warm-$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd').log
```

**Before Important Analysis:**
- Run cache warming 15-30 minutes before executive presentations
- Warm cache after major data ingestion or Aparavi updates
- Schedule during off-hours to avoid impacting production queries

#### Enterprise Performance Tips

**üîÑ Query Response Optimization:**
- **Small results first**: Ask for "top 10" or "last 30 days" before broad queries
- **Use date filters**: "Files created since 2024" vs. "all files ever"
- **Specific locations**: "Finance department files" vs. "all company files"

**‚ö° Conversation Flow:**
```
1. "Check Aparavi server health" (verifies connection)
2. "Show me storage usage by top 5 departments" (quick overview)
3. "Find duplicate files over 100MB in finance folders" (specific analysis)
4. "Run complete storage optimization workflow" (comprehensive analysis)
```

**üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Recommendations:**
- **Aparavi Server**: 8GB+ RAM, SSD storage for optimal query performance
- **Docker Resources**: Increase Docker Desktop memory to 4GB+ for large datasets
- **Network**: Ensure gigabit connection between Aparavi server and client

#### Troubleshooting Large Environment Issues

**"Query timeout" or "Connection reset":**
```powershell
# Increase timeout and run cache warming in batches
.\scripts\run-all-reports.ps1 -Interactive
# Select smaller subsets of reports to run
```

**"Out of memory" errors:**
- Restart Aparavi Data Suite service
- Increase system RAM or reduce concurrent queries
- Use filters to limit query scope: "last 6 months" instead of "all time"

**Slow Docker performance:**
- Increase Docker Desktop memory allocation
- Use local installation method for very large environments
- Consider running MCP server directly on Aparavi server machine

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

### Power User Tips

**Combine Multiple Queries:**
```
Run a storage audit workflow, then find all duplicate files over 100MB,
and finally show me files that haven't been accessed in 6 months
```

**Create Custom Searches:**
```
Find all Excel files created by users in the finance department
that contain the word "budget" and were modified in the last 30 days
